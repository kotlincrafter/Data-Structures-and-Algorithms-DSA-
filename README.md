# ðŸ“˜ Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) With C++ <br>

This repository contains my implementations and practice problems for Data Structures and Algorithms.
It is designed to serve as a reference for learning, practicing, and improving problem-solving skills in competitive programming and technical interviews.<br>

# ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside

ðŸ”¹ Implementations of core Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hashing, Heaps, etc.)

ðŸ”¹ Solutions to popular Algorithmic Problems (Searching, Sorting, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Backtracking, Graph Algorithms, etc.)

ðŸ”¹ Well-structured and beginner-friendly C++/Java/Python code (choose based on your repo language).

ðŸ”¹ Organized by topic-wise and difficulty level.

# ðŸŽ¯ Goals

Strengthen problem-solving and coding skills

Prepare for technical interviews & coding contests

Build a solid foundation in DSA concepts
